In a society that revolves around work, maximizing your productivity can be difficult. If your life often feels like a never-ending to do list or you feel like there’s never enough time, there’s a helpful solution for that. Maximizing your productivity will allow you to maximize your free time, minimizing your daily stress!

A great organization tool to use for time-management and planning is Google Calendar. Google calendar is a completely free calendar service that enables digital management of your events. Many people use a calendar, but not many people use it to its full potential. 

## Here are some tips and tricks to get the most out of your calendar, and your day!
1. Group your tasks
	Start by making a master list of everything that may go on in your week. These may include daily repeated events like work or school, routine tasks like morning and night routines, tasks, assignments, and so on. Once you’ve got your commitments sorted out, you can move onto the next step.

2. Time block your calendar
	Time blocking is a process that organizes your calendar by the hour. Start by entering in your repeat events and routines. Consider using color coding to organize these events by category or type.

3. Fill in daily / weekly tasks
	Now that your calendar consists of the recurring events of the week, you can now enter in your less-common to-do items. The previous time-blocking allows you to see the time gaps in your day so that you can prioritize other tasks in your free-time. By organizing your day by the hour, you can get more things done!
    - Tip: Consider using Google Keep, or Google Tasks (You can find them on the right-hand side of Google Calendar) to display your prioritized tasks in the margins!).

4. Repeat the process 
    Now that you have the overall gist of your week, you can more efficiently plan your time in advance. Personally, I like to use Sunday as a scheduling day so I can get an idea of how I can best utilize my time or get an idea of how busy or free my week will be.
